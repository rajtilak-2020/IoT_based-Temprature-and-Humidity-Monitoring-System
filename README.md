### 🎯 **Features**
- 🌟 **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Track temperature and humidity remotely.  
- 📱 **Mobile Integration**: Use the Blynk App for easy visualization.  
- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Budget-friendly solution with open-source hardware and software.  
- 🔌 **Portable & Lightweight**: Ideal for multiple real-life applications.
